(1) In task problem where we are given strt and end time we can 
   sort them according to end time.

2) We can take a set and insert some value in set and use lowerbound and erase.

3) use global approch and try to optimiz proof it .like itrate in  a vector and try to solve 
   any nearest index first.

4) Egyptian Fraction :- a/b = 1/x1 + 1/x2 +...... where b>a;
                      6/14 is 1/3 + 1/11 + 1/231
    (i) 14/6 = 2.333 means 6/14 = 1/2.333 nearest 1/x which is smaller than 1/2.333
       is 1/3.                     
    (ii) now (6/14 - 1/3) = 4/42 reamians then again repeat (i)

(5) we can solve a problem by starting with end also.
